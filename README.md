I saw a post on stack overflow showing a big brain way of solving this.
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2245801/code-golf-tic-tac-toe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2245801/code-golf-tic-tac-toe)

Basically, the idea is that all the "win positions" add up to 12.

```
 5 | 0 | 7
---+---+---
 6 | 4 | 2
---+---+---
 1 | 8 | 3
```
